Reflection on Software Testing and Development Skills
Ensuring Functionality and Security

Throughout this course, I learned how to ensure that my code, program, or software is both functional and secure using industry-standard practices. I used unit testing with JUnit, a widely-used tool in the industry, to check that each part of my program works correctly. These tests help catch mistakes early, making sure that the software does what itâ€™s supposed to do. For security, I applied best practices like validating user input and handling errors properly. These practices are crucial for protecting the software from potential security threats. By regularly updating the software and fixing any vulnerabilities, I ensure that the program remains safe and secure over time.

Interpreting User Needs

In this class, I learned how to effectively interpret user needs and turn them into a working program. This is an important skill in the industry because software must meet the expectations of its users. I started by understanding what the users want and then created features that match those needs. For example, in Project One, I designed a contact management system based on user requirements for adding, updating, and deleting contacts. I used test cases to check that the software behaves as users would expect, which is a standard practice in the industry to ensure the software is user-friendly and effective.

Approach to Designing Software

My approach to designing software has become more structured and focused on industry standards. I learned to break down a project into smaller, manageable parts, which makes it easier to develop and test. This modular design approach is common in the industry because it helps in building software that is both reliable and easy to maintain. I also considered how the software might need to grow or change in the future, which is important for making sure the program remains useful over time. By planning ahead and using these design principles, I can create software that is well-organized, scalable, and adaptable.
